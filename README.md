# udacity-repo
This repo is the work completed in Udacity's nanodegree program for data engineering with AWS. The file name will be named the same as the title of the Jupyter notebook that Udacity provides in the exercise being completed.

The point of creating the exercises in this repo is to make sure I know how the internet of things works and can recreate what the Jupyter notebooks are doing but with my own database.
